la36

la36 is a terminal and a printer emulation. It is derived from a program
named greenbar, written in 2013 by Egan Ford.

To use la36 as a printer:

	la36 -i file -h -n

-i file inputs from file, which can be a file or a fifo (man mkfifo)
In printer mode, there is no keyboard control. -h "holds" the display
on exit, and -n translates unix \n to \r\n.

As a note - la36 requires xterm and sox. It restarts itself with xterm,
if xterm is not the terminal emulator currently in use. sox is used to
provide audio. The aiff and wav files should be copied to
/usr/local/share/la36 xterm should be available at /usr/bin/xterm and
the sox "play" command at /usr/bin/play

la36 requires its font files(otf and ttf_ be installed. In most Linux
systems, these go to ~/.fonts

In printer mode, all options must be specified on the command line.


la36 [-q] [-u] [-h] [-x] [-t trigger] [-c cps] [-f len] [-1] [-2] [-3] [-n]
     [-e ] [-d device]

  -d device  serial device
  -i file    input file/fifo
  -q         quiet (no sound)
  -u         uppercase
  -h         hold after exit
  -x         force xterm relaunch
  -z char    set trigger (default A)
  -c cps     set cps 10..4000 (default 30)
  -f length  set form length
  -1         use font 1 (Monaco)
  -2         set form 2 (mnicmp)
  -3         set form 3 (SV Basic Manual)
  -n         translate \n to \r\n
  -e         local echo
  -t         enable asr (^Q/^S, ^R/^T
  -?         this help

You must choose one of -i or -d. If -i is used, -h (hold) is very useful, as
is -n, because the data is probably unix (with newlines only).



To use la36 as a terminal:

	la36 -d /dev/ttyUSB0

When in terminal mode ^A (control A) is a trigger. ^AH displays help,
(and status, and then waits for a key -- note the status line for
prompts!)

la36 has quite a few options in terminal mode. The emulated speed can
be changed from 10 to 4000 characters per second (audio only works
at 120cps and under). Form length can be set (0 is continous), font
can be selected 1 = Monaro, 2 = mnicmp and 3 = SVBasicManual.
I like SVBasicManual, as this is VERY close to the Diablo 630 font
"back in the day". mnicmp is very close to the la36 font.

Local line feed and form feeds can be done. Upper-case only mode can
be specified (Teletype style operation). Files can be sent and
received (even ^Q/^S, ^R/^T asr operation if desired, but that is
not extensively tested yet).

^A! followed by enter for a shell (or local command). ^ABcommand
executes a command, with stdin/stdout linked to the serial port.
That is meant to run rx, sx and other transfer commands.
la36 can be "silenced" with ^AQ.

The ^AZ command dumps the receive queue. la36 emulates a terminal
at, say, 30 cps, but the connection may be USB at an effective
115200. If this happens, data is queued up, and may take a LONG
time to print. ^AZ dumps the queued data, and allows la36 to
"catch up".

I used Mike Douglas' PUNMSG (with SIO output added) to punch
readable tape leaders from my Altair-Duino. Program readtape.c
will display that data in a human readable form. This was done
as part of the receive data function test.

la36 does overprint to attribute conversion. Bold, underscore and
strike-through are generated. This make la36 a "fun" device for
WordStar printing!

Note that the trigger character (^A) cannot be changed after la36
is started. The -t option (-t _ for example) is the only way to
set the trigger. As well, the -x option forces the relaunch under
xterm, is only available from the command line.

The send/receive options and commands are too complicated and
require a bit of re-thinking to simplify. Suggestions welcome!
Note that we want to support manual tape operations, ASR tape
operations mapping tapes/cassettes to disk files. In a way
that resembles old school ASR-33 or dual cassette operations.
Note that I do not (yet) attempt to support ^E ENQ / WRU 
functions. Even if available, most people disabled those
functions "back in the day" -- due to tape punch/read issues.
(as far as I recall, anyway).
